👋 Hi there! I'm Jurgen Kruja, a passionate Developer with expertise in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, PHP, MySQL, Next, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma, Sequelize, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

🎓 I hold a MSc Diploma in Software Engineering from European University of Tirana and a Bachelor's Diploma in Applied Math from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Tirana.

💼 With a solid foundation built over the years, I've contributed my skills at Ionian, spent almost a decade at Morix, and I'm currently part of the dynamic team at RevZone Solution.

🚀 I love crafting efficient and user-friendly solutions, and my GitHub is a reflection of my journey, featuring projects that showcase my dedication to the world of software development.
