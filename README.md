👋 Hi there! I'm Jurgen Kruja, a passionate Developer and Lecturer in Software Development at the Faculty of Engineering, Informatics and Architecture at the European University of Tirana.

💻 I specialize in React, Next, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, PHP, MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma, Sequelize, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

🎓 I hold an MSc Diploma in Software Engineering from the European University of Tirana and a Bachelor's Diploma in Applied Math from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Tirana.

💼 Over the years, I've built a solid foundation in software development, contributing my skills at Ionian, spending almost a decade at Morix, and currently being part of the dynamic team at RevZone Solution.

🚀 I love crafting efficient and user-friendly solutions. My GitHub showcases a selection of my journey through public projects, though I also work on more advanced private repositories that aren't visible here.
